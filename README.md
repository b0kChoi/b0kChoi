Howdy! I'm b0kChoi, Choi for short, and my pronouns are Ze/Hir or mirror pronouns.
I'm interested in too much for my own good tbh, everything from emulators to compilers (I need to focus I know).
Languages I'm focused on rn are Scheme, Emacs Lisp, HTML/CSS, and Kotlin.
Currently a philosphy/classical studies nerd/student, trying to learn attic greek.
uuhhhhh that's about it ask me anything ig
