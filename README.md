Howdy! I'm b0kChoi, Choi for short, and my pronouns are Ze/Hir or mirror pronouns.
I'm interested in too much for my own good tbh, everything from programming to mathematics to powerlifting to classical studies 
and too much more to list (like juggling).
Currently pursuing a double major (Classical studies + Archaeology).
Oh, and trying to learn French+German (alongside the mandatory attic greek...).
Ask me anything ig
