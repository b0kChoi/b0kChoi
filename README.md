Howdy! I'm B0kchoi, Choi for short, and my pronouns are Ze/Hir or mirror pronouns.
I'm TRYING to program in my free time, and slowly learn as much as I can.
I'm interested in too much for my own good tbh, everything from emulators to compilers
Languages I'm focused on rn are Scheme, Emacs Lisp, HTML/CSS, and Kotlin
uuhhhhh that's about it ask me anything ig
